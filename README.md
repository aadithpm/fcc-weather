#Weather Forecast with Yahoo! Weather
##### A project as part of FreeCodeCamp's curiculum

One of the main difficulties in this was the working of the Geolocation API, or the lack of it thereof. I turned to the [IPInfo API](http://ipinfo.io) for these details and it graciously provided me with the coordinates of the user. I found a very good weather API on Mashape, [courtesy of fyhao](https://market.mashape.com/fyhao/weather-13), which pulled weather forecast data from Yahoo! Weather and this worked superbly as well. I wanted to try something new and found [jBox](https://stephanwagner.me/jBox/) by Stephan Wagner, a jQuery plugin for pretty looking tooltips and modals. The next step in this is to look at providing forecast details for the next day, which should be easy, and the previous day, which I have to think about.
